        description: "It’s true. Education in Germany is both high-quality and either free, or dead cheap. As an international student in the USA, expect to pay up to $45–50,000 per year of undergraduate college tuition. The largest fee I’ve seen in Germany is under €2000 (even for international students). And usually that tuition includes a local transport pass and other perks. Most are free or only charge a small fee (€150–400). Germany has large cities and peaceful nature, relatively cheap rents, excellent healthcare, good job security, and is a fantastic place to live",

        description: "The problem with this question is, a lot of people do want to study in Germany. Medical school in Germany is free. That’s incredible. People know this and therefore apply to study here. And because competition is so fierce, only students in the top top percentile are successful. If you aren’t in the top 5–1% in your class, it’s not worth applying to medical school in Germany. Look instead to the USA or UK — there is simply no chance. Music conservatory is also free. Juilliard costs $47,370 a year. The country is scattered with some of the best conservatories (Hanns Eisler Berlin, Universität der Künste, Hamburg, Münich). Pretty much every major city has a world class music school. Naturally, students from all over the world travel here every spring to audition. Germany, by allowing foreign students to have access to a low cost education, is encouraging top talent from around the globe to come study, learn German, and hopefully stay afterwards. A win-win situation.",

        description: "I am fascinated by the ambivalence in many of the answers in how Germany‘s offer of 'free education' is experienced. Many writers appreciate the opportunity of not having to pay for their lectures and degrees. But there is an undertone of disappointment among others that „free“ does not apply to the whole experience of being in Germany. It might be helpful to talk about expectations for someone considering coming to Germany to study, as a number of writers see a mismatch between the promise of free education and the cultural assumptions about how study and work in Germany are understood.",

        description: "That’s hard to answer, because it all depended on 'which' German you asked. One of my cousins, who served in Afrika Korps (assigned to an 88 crew and was also a medic), was taken prisoner at Tobruk. He was originally transferred to a British POW camp in Scotland (he would eventually end up in Canada) and used to help the Brits as a medic and also as an interpreter (especially during interrogations). He said he was always amazed at the arrogance of the German POWs he encountered. Here they were in a POW camp in Scotland and these guys were acting like it was the British who were the prisoners! He said they were cocky and absolutely convinced that Germany would win the war. Later, in Canada, as late as 1944, many of the prisoners thought that “somehow” Germany would win; maybe it was a secret deal with the West or maybe it was the rumored “wunderwaffe” or “wonder weapons” they’d heard about.",

        description: "I'm 41, started to self learn programming 3 years ago, I can say now that I'm pretty comfortable using many programming languages, Python, C#, plus web front end, HTML, CSS, SASS, and Vanilla JavaScript, and some knowledge in C++ and Java, All that while having a really stressful fulltime job, and a family, a wife and a daughter. What I mean is that I don't have the time to study a lot, and my profession isn't strictly coupled to programming, I don't get to practice a lot during my working hours, so the answer to your question is YES YOU CAN, specially if you can dedicate more time and resources to that purpose, and to have a very defined target that is web dev, I didn't, Python for me was much related to my work than web dev, so that's where I focused. Web dev is a long journey but it comes in chunks, start with HTML and some CSS, that's a must for everyone, then move to front end, or back end, depending on what you like, do you find yourself more into design, layout and user experience? Then learn everything about CSS, JavaScript and go from there to preprocessors libraries and APIs. Are you more into functionality? Well you still need to learn JavaScript, specially if you decide to use NodeJS for back end, Then choose a stack, MERN, MEVN, MEAN…etc, and go from there. If you complete one of these paths, you can call yoursel a pretty good front end or back end web developer. You can be a very good web developer at 40, fullstack is a very long journey in my opinion, but not everyone has to be a fullstack web developer, so your age isn't the main factor here, the main factor is your willingness to learn, your circumstances, comes next, how much time can you dedicate to learning, and practicing",

Emotional independence: Financial and emotional independence from parents. They tend to make their own life decisions. 4. Treat others correctly: They don't belittle or make fun of others because it's not their way to gain self-esteem. They are confident. 5.

You realize that most people's bad behavior stems from fear and anxiety, not from filthy or stupidity, as people usually think. You put down your self-righteous attitude, no longer think that the world is only monsters or fools. Things are no longer black and white, but over time, it becomes much more interesting. 2. You understand that other people don't naturally understand what you think. You have to express your intention and feelings clearly in your own words. Don't blame others for not understanding you unless you can articulate your ideas clearly. 3. You realize unexpectedly that sometimes you can do something wrong. You bravely take the first faltering step and learn to apologize (occasionally for mistakes)",
